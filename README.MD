# Stock Analysis Python

## Project

This is a very simple stock analysis script in python. The aim is to see the performance of tech stocks and their performacne during covid and post covid. The analysis that can be drawn is that during covid tech stocks had a rally to the upside potentially due to government invervention and stimulus to keep companies healthy. However, after covid there was a signifcant drop in price potentially due to increase in inflation.
